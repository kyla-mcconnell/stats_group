Have you always wanted to improve your statistical analysis skills? Have you downloaded R, but never opened it? Do your hands start to sweat when you're just thinking about math?

If you've answered 'yes' to at least one of these questions, fear no more! The statistics study group is here to help!

We're a group of MA students, PhDs and Postdocs who meet up regularly to read about and practice statistics together. We're based in Freiburg, Germany, but now putting our resources online for a wider reach. 

The group is moderated by [Kyla McConnell](https://kyla-mcconnell.github.io/website/index.html) and Julia MÃ¼ller. Find us on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/McconnellKyla) and [here](https://twitter.com/JuliaMl94290124) and Kyla on Github [here](https://github.com/kyla-mcconnell).

This website is made entirely in R Markdown. To make your own, check out [this tutorial by Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/tutorials/webpages.html#webpage-online).
